##  Team Data 
A central question to analyze how the team performed is to judge it's peformance against<br>
its competitors and metrics set forward by the league.  PSG has over performed it's competitors<br> 
since 2011. 2011 marked the first year after ownership of PSG changed hands and large scale<br> 
investment in the transfer market began.  Looking at the data, you can see a consistent and<br> 
accelerating uptick in the amount of points that PSG is winning.  Interestingly, PSG peers<br> 
seem to have up and down seasons where PSG has been able to maintain a steady top level of<br> 
performance.<br>

Across European Soccer leagues, the winner of a given league is the team that collects the<br>
most points after playing a season (38 games) against it’s competitors. Three points are<br> 
awarded for a wine, one point for a draw, and none for a defeat, with the team with the most<br>
ponts at the end of the season winning the league title. Using the 2013-2014 top 4 finishers<br>
as a becnhmark across five leagues, the below graph is PSG’s total points versus the top 4<br> 
competitors in each of the English, French, Spanish, German and Italian leagues.<br>

Goal differential data is an important indicator of how well a team is performing. A team<br> 
that is able to limit it’s opponents goals by having strong defense and goalkeeping that<br> 
is also able to pass and score more effectively have a significantly better chance of winning<br>
more games, and drawing more games against close competitors. Generally, PSG is winning it’s<br>
games by a lot larger margins than what its peers are doing. This demonstrates that the team<br> 
that the team that PSG has put together is significantly more competitive and productive than<br> 
the rest.<br>
